According to the Chapel Diamond Jubilee booklet *"The seed of Methodism was first sown in North Derbyshire at a lonely farm house known as "Barmoor" in the year 1738"* 

Initially meetings were held in the barn at Barmoor Farm on the hillside opposite the current chapel, but after about 50 years a small chapel was built in the village.

The current Chapel and School were built on the same site in 1892 at a cost of Â£740 which was raised in a short time after the opening.
