According to the Chapel Diamond Jubilee booklet *"The seed of Methodism was first sown in North Derbyshire at a lonely farm house known as "Barmoor" in the year 1738"* 

Some feeling for the start of the community can be gained from the Extracts from ["The Blacksmith of the Peak; or, village piety and usefulness, exemplified in the life of the late John Hallam, of Sparrowpit, Derbyshire"](http://peakdistricthallamfamily.weebly.com/extracts-from-blacksmith-of-the-peak.html)

Initially meetings were held in the barn at Barmoor Farm on the hillside opposite the current chapel, but after about 50 years a small chapel was built in the village.

The current Chapel and School were built on the same site in 1892 at a cost of Â£740 which was raised in a short time after the opening.

##Covid

During the Covid pandemic like many churches we had lots of online gatherings, and one particularly talented member of our congregation put together a special Easter Service which you can still see here:
