#Welcome to Sparrowpit Methodist Church

Since 1738 Methodists have been meeting and worshipping at Sparrowpit. Many of those still meeting at the church can trace their ancestors to those first Methodists gathered in a barn at Barmoor Farm.

We are a  rural congregation, enjoying traditional worship and the well-known methodist hymns (if it's in parts so much the better)
