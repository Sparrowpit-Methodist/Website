#Traditions of Sparrowpit

##Christmas

Christmas is a special occasion in every Christian community, but we like to think that in Sparrowpit we are a little bit special.

For as long as anyone can remember Christmas has started at 5.30am at the top of the village when we gather to sing "Christians Awake" to rouse our neighbours for the festive day.

We then proceed down the village discussing where the next stop will be, and pausing for all our friends and neighbours as we sing at various points and our numbers swell. 

Our final stop just before 6am is outside the church where sing again before going in for our service.

But don't think the singing will stop at the end of the service, it has only just begun...

##Carols

In common with many villages in North Derbyshire and South Yorkshire we have our own traditional carols in Sparrowpit; do you know the tune *Grandfather* to "Hark the Herald" and how many tunes do you know to "While Shepherds Watched"?

##Christingle

Not all our traditions are ancient, in recent years we have adopted the tradition of a Christingle service which has been a great success, especially with the children!
